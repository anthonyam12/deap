6/6/2017:
	- Added a threshold parameter to the eaSimple aglorithm in algorithms.py
		- This parameter allows for early stopping conditions in this algorithm
		- The parameter should be passed as a float between 0.0 and 1.0 and should
		  represent the fraction of generations (ngen) we want to carry on making 
		  no progress before early exit
		- That is, if we have the same max (or min) from our cost function for 
		  threshold*ngen iterations, we break from the loop
		- Added this to be able to set pretty high generations so I can 'use them
		  if I need them'. If I get lucky and get the optimal solution right away
		  then I only run for threshold*ngen iterations. Otherwise, the algorithm
		  can run the whole, say 100,000, iterations if we're getting unlucky 
		  selections/mutations
